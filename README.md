# Digital Etch a Sketch

## My solution to the Etch a Sketch project for The Odin Project

In this project I learned about different ways to create a grid of CSS objects. To hightlight the different paths I took until reaching the final product, I created 4 different branches. Each one contains the implementation of the grid using a different method, as suggested within the project instructions. It was really interesting to see how the same results could be acheived with 4 different methods!

Event listeners were also a main focus of this topic. I created a function that changes a class on each grid item to change the color with each pass of the mouse until the darkest color is reached.

I also tried to account for all the different types of input the user might provide after the reset button is pressed, as they could enter a word, hit cancel, leave the input box blank, etc.
